Weather Forecast Tool - Architectural Flow
The Weather Forecast Tool is a command-line application that retrieves and displays the current weather forecast for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The tool is implemented in Python and leverages the requests library for making HTTP requests and the json library for parsing JSON responses.

Flow Description:
The user is prompted to enter the name of the city for which they want to retrieve the weather forecast.

The user's input is validated to ensure it contains only alphabetic characters and spaces. If the input is invalid, an error message is displayed, and the flow terminates.

If the input is valid, an API request is made to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for the specified city.

The request includes the city name, API key, and the desired units (metric) as query parameters.

The API response is checked for any HTTP errors. If an error occurs, an appropriate error message is displayed, and the flow terminates.

If the API request is successful, the JSON response is parsed into a Python dictionary using the json.loads() method.

Relevant weather information such as the city name, temperature (in both Celsius and Fahrenheit), humidity, wind speed, cloud coverage, sunrise and sunset times, and weather description are extracted from the parsed data.

The extracted weather information is displayed to the user in a formatted manner, including the current date.

If the API request fails or the weather data is not available, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.

The flow completes, and the user can either exit the tool or enter another city name to fetch the weather forecast.

Feel free to modify and enhance the architectural flow description based on your specific implementation and requirements.
